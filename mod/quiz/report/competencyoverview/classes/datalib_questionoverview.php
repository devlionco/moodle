/**
 * Code for loading and saving question attempts to and from the database.
 *
 * Note that many of the methods of this class should be considered private to
 * the question engine. They should be accessed through the
 * {@link question_engine} class. For example, you should call
 * {@link question_engine::save_questions_usage_by_activity()} rather than
 * {@link question_engine_data_mapper::insert_questions_usage_by_activity()}.
 * The exception to this is some of the reporting methods, like
 * {@link question_engine_data_mapper::load_attempts_at_question()}.
 *
 * (TODO, probably we should split this class up, so that it has no public
 * methods. They should all be moved to a new public class.)
 *
 * A note for future reference. This code is pretty efficient but there are some
 * potential optimisations that could be contemplated, at the cost of making the
 * code more complex:
 *
 * 1. (This is probably not worth doing.) In the unit-of-work save method, we
 *    could get all the ids for steps due to be deleted or modified,
 *    and delete all the question_attempt_step_data for all of those steps in one
 *    query. That would save one DB query for each ->stepsupdated. However that number
 *    is 0 except when re-grading, and when regrading, there are many more inserts
 *    into question_attempt_step_data than deletes, so it is really hardly worth it.
